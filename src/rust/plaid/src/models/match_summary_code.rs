/// MatchSummaryCode : An enum indicating the match type between data provided by user and data checked against an external data source.   `match` indicates that the provided input data was a strong match against external data.  `partial_match` indicates the data approximately matched against external data. For example, \"Knope\" vs. \"Knope-Wyatt\" for last name.  `no_match` indicates that Plaid was able to perform a check against an external data source and it did not match the provided input data.  `no_data` indicates that Plaid was unable to find external data to compare against the provided input data.  `no_input` indicates that Plaid was unable to perform a check because no information was provided for this field by the end user.
