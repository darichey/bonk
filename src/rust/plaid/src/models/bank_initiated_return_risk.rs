/// BankInitiatedReturnRisk : The object contains a risk score and a risk tier that evaluate the transaction return risk because an account is overdrawn or because an ineligible account is used. Common return codes in this category include: \"R01\", \"R02\", \"R03\", \"R04\", \"R06\", \"R08\",  \"R09\", \"R13\", \"R16\", \"R17\", \"R20\", \"R23\". These returns have a turnaround time of 2 banking days.
