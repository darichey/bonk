/// NewAccountsAvailableWebhook : Fired when Plaid detects a new account. Upon receiving this webhook, you can prompt your users to share new accounts with you through [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/#using-update-mode-to-request-new-accounts) (US/CA only). If the end user has opted not to share new accounts with Plaid via their institution's OAuth settings, Plaid will not detect new accounts and this webhook will not fire. For end user accounts in the EU and UK, upon receiving this webhook, you can prompt your user to re-link their account and then delete the old Item via `/item/remove`.
