/// BeaconReportCreateResponse : A Beacon Report describes the type of fraud committed by a user as well as the date the fraud was committed and the total amount of money lost due to the fraud incident.  This information is used to block similar fraud attempts on your platform as well as alert other companies who screen a user with matching identity information. Other companies will not receive any new identity information, just what matched, plus information such as industry, type of fraud, and date of fraud.  You can manage your fraud reports by adding, deleting, or editing reports as you get additional information on fraudulent users.
