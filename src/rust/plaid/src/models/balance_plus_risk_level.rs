/// BalancePlusRiskLevel : A five-tier risk assessment for the transaction, based on the probability distribution of ACH returns, measured by the incident rate.   Each tier corresponds to a distribution with a different mean (average) probability.   `HIGH`: The mean probability of ACH return risk is above 40%. `MEDIUM_HIGH`: The mean probability of ACH return risk is 15%-40%.  `MEDIUM`: The mean probability of ACH return risk is 5-10%. `MEDIUM_LOW`: The mean probability of ACH return risk is 1%-2%. `LOW`: The mean probability of ACH return risk is below 1%.   Note that these tiers correspond to probability *distributions* and not to discrete probabilities.   These tier definitions are specific to Balance Plus and do not apply to risk tiers generated by other Plaid endpoints.
