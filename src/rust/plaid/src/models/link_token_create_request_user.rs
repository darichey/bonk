For a small number of customers on legacy flows, providing this field is required to enable micro-deposit-based flows. For all other customers, this field is optional. Providing the user's name in this field when using micro-deposit-based verification will streamline the end user experience, as the user will not be prompted to enter their name during the Link flow; Plaid will use the provided legal name instead.
