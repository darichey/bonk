/// PendingDisconnectWebhook : Fired when an Item is expected to be disconnected. The webhook will currently be fired 7 days before the existing Item is scheduled for disconnection. This can be resolved by having the user go through Link’s [update mode](http://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode). Currently, this webhook is fired only for US or Canadian institutions; in the UK or EU, you should continue to listed for the [`PENDING_EXPIRATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#pending_expiration) webhook instead.
