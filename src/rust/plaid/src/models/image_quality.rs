/// ImageQuality : A high level description of the quality of the image the user submitted.  For example, an image that is blurry, distorted by glare from a nearby light source, or improperly framed might be marked as low or medium quality. Poor quality images are more likely to fail OCR and/or template conformity checks.  Note: By default, Plaid will let a user recapture document images twice before failing the entire session if we attribute the failure to low image quality.
