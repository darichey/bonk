/// WalletTransactionStatus : The status of the transaction.  `AUTHORISING`: The transaction is being processed for validation and compliance.  `INITIATED`: The transaction has been initiated and is currently being processed.  `EXECUTED`: The transaction has been successfully executed and is considered complete. This is only applicable for debit transactions.  `SETTLED`: The transaction has settled and funds are available for use. This is only applicable for credit transactions. A transaction will typically settle within seconds to several days, depending on which payment rail is used.  `FAILED`: The transaction failed to process successfully. This is a terminal status.  `BLOCKED`: The transaction has been blocked for violating compliance rules. This is a terminal status.
