/// RiskCheckBehaviorUserInteractionsLabel : Field describing the overall user interaction signals of a behavior risk check. This value represents how familiar the user is with the personal data they provide, based on a number of signals that are collected during their session.  `genuine` indicates the user has high familiarity with the data they are providing, and that fraud is unlikely.  `neutral` indicates some signals are present in between `risky` and `genuine`, but there are not enough clear signals to determine an outcome.  `risky` indicates the user has low familiarity with the data they are providing, and that fraud is likely.  `no_data` indicates there is not sufficient information to give an accurate signal.
