/// CustomerInitiatedReturnRisk : The object contains a risk score and a risk tier that evaluate the transaction return risk of an unauthorized debit. Common return codes in this category include: \"R05\", \"R07\", \"R10\", \"R11\", \"R29\". These returns typically have a return time frame of up to 60 calendar days.
