/// TransferAuthorizationGuaranteeDecisionRationaleCode : A code representing the reason Plaid declined to guarantee this transfer:  `RETURN_BANK`: The risk of a bank-initiated return (for example, an R01/NSF) is too high to guarantee this transfer.  `RETURN_CUSTOMER`: The risk of a customer-initiated return (for example, a R10/Unauthorized) is too high to guarantee this transfer.  `GUARANTEE_LIMIT_REACHED`: This transfer is low-risk, but Guarantee has exhausted an internal limit on the number or rate of guarantees that applies to this transfer.  `RISK_ESTIMATE_UNAVAILABLE`: A risk estimate is unavailable for this Item.  `REQUIRED_PARAM_MISSING`: Required fields are missing.
