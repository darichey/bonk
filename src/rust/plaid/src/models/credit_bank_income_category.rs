/// CreditBankIncomeCategory : The income category.  `BANK_INTEREST`: Interest earned from a bank account. `BENEFIT_OTHER`: Government benefits other than retirement, unemployment, child support, or disability. Currently used only in the UK, to represent benefits such as Cost of Living Payments. `CASH`: Deprecated and used only for existing legacy implementations. Has been replaced by `CASH_DEPOSIT` and `TRANSFER_FROM_APPLICATION`. `CASH_DEPOSIT`: A cash or check deposit. `CHILD_SUPPORT`: Child support payments received. `GIG_ECONOMY`: Income earned as a gig economy worker, e.g. driving for Uber, Lyft, Postmates, DoorDash, etc. `LONG_TERM_DISABILITY`: Disability payments, including Social Security disability benefits. `OTHER`: Income that could not be categorized as any other income category. `MILITARY`: Veterans benefits. Income earned as salary for serving in the military (e.g. through DFAS) will be classified as `SALARY` rather than `MILITARY`.  `RENTAL`: Income earned from a rental property. Income may be identified as rental when the payment is received through a rental platform, e.g. Airbnb; rent paid directly by the tenant to the property owner (e.g. via cash, check, or ACH) will typically not be classified as rental income.  `RETIREMENT`: Payments from private retirement systems, pensions, and government retirement programs, including Social Security retirement benefits. `SALARY`: Payment from an employer to an earner or other form of permanent employment. `TAX_REFUND`: A tax refund. `TRANSFER_FROM_APPLICATION`: Deposits from a money transfer app, such as Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. `UNEMPLOYMENT`: Unemployment benefits. In the UK, includes certain low-income benefits such as the Universal Credit.
