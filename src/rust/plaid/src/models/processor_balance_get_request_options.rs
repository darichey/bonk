    /// Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the oldest acceptable balance when making a request to `/accounts/balance/get`.  This field is only necessary when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One), *and* one or more account types being requested is a non-depository account (such as a credit card) as Capital One does not provide real-time balance for non-depository accounts. In this case, a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For all other institutions, as well as for depository accounts at Capital One (including all checking and savings accounts) this field is ignored and real-time balance information will be fetched.  If this field is not ignored, and no acceptable balance is available, an `INVALID_RESULT` error with the code `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned.
