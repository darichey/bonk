/// RecurringFrequency : Describes the frequency of the transaction stream.  `WEEKLY`: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every week.  `BIWEEKLY`: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every 2 weeks.  `SEMI_MONTHLY`: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately twice per month. This frequency is typically seen for inflow transaction streams.  `MONTHLY`: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every month.  `ANNUALLY`: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every year.  `DAILY`: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every day.  `DYNAMIC`: Assigned to a transaction stream that varies in recurrence frequency. This frequency is typically seen for inflow streams in the gig economy.  `UNKNOWN`: Assigned to a transaction stream that isn't recurring in nature.
