/// ProcessorInitialUpdateWebhook : This webhook is only sent to [Plaid processor partners](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/).  Fired when an Item's initial transaction pull is completed. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data for the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. If [Account Select v2](https://plaid.com/docs/link/customization/#account-select) is enabled, this webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with `new_transactions` set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.  This webhook is intended for use with `/processor/transactions/get`; if you are using the newer `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook instead.
