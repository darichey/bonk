/// TransferIntentCreateNetwork : The network or rails used for the transfer. Defaults to `same-day-ach`.  For transfers submitted as `ach`, the next-day cutoff is 5:30 PM Eastern Time.  For transfers submitted as `same-day-ach`, the same-day cutoff is 3:30 PM Eastern Time. If the transfer is submitted after this cutoff but before the next-day cutoff, it will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges; this will apply to both legs of the transfer if applicable.
