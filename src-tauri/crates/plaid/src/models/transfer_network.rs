/// TransferNetwork : The network or rails used for the transfer.  For transfers submitted as either `ach` or `same-day-ach` the cutoff for same-day is 3:30 PM Eastern Time and the cutoff for next-day transfers is 5:30 PM Eastern Time. It is recommended to submit a transfer at least 15 minutes before the cutoff time in order to ensure that it will be processed before the cutoff. Any transfer that is indicated as `same-day-ach` and that misses the same-day cutoff, but is submitted in time for the next-day cutoff, will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges. Note that both legs of the transfer will be downgraded if applicable.  For transfers submitted as `rtp`,  Plaid will automatically route between Real Time Payment rail by TCH or FedNow rails as necessary. If a transfer is submitted as `rtp` and the counterparty account is not eligible for RTP, the `/transfer/authorization/create` request will fail with an `INVALID_FIELD` error code. To pre-check to determine whether a counterparty account can support RTP, call `/transfer/capabilities/get` before calling `/transfer/authorization/create`.
