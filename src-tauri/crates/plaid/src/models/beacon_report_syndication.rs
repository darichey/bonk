/// BeaconReportSyndication : A Beacon Report Syndication represents a Beacon Report created either by your organization or another Beacon customer that matches a specific Beacon User you've created.  The `analysis` field in the response indicates which fields matched between the originally reported Beacon User and the Beacon User that the report was syndicated to.  The `report` field in the response contains a subset of information from the original report.
