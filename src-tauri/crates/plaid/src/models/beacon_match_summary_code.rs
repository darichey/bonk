/// BeaconMatchSummaryCode : An enum indicating the match type between two Beacon Users.   `match` indicates that the provided input data was a strong match against the other Beacon User.  `partial_match` indicates the data approximately matched the other Beacon User. For example, \"Knope\" vs. \"Knope-Wyatt\" for last name.  `no_match` indicates that Plaid was able to compare this field against the other Beacon User and it did not match the provided input data.  `no_data` indicates that Plaid was unable to compare this field against the original Beacon User because the field was not present in one of the Beacon Users.
